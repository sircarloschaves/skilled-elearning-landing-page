## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For the first time I practiced the difference between the 3 layouts: Mobile, Tablet and Desktop.
I managed to assimilate the use of the grid in the layout well.

### Continued development

Because I faced a difficulty in positioning the main image on the desktop, I will practice this part a lot more so that I will soon use better techniques to do the same.

I also want to make typography 100% responsive for much larger screens in future projects.
